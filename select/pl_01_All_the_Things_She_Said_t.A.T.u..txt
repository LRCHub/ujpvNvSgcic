ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD

ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID
ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD

ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
I'M IN SERIOUS SHIT
I FEEL TOTALLY LOST
IF I'M ASKING FOR HELP
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
BEING WITH YOU HAS
OPENED MY EYES
WHO COULD EVER BELIEVE
SUCH A PERFECT SURPRISE
I KEEP ASKING MYSELF
WONDERING HOW
I KEEP CLOSING MY EYES
BUT I CAN'T BLOCK YOU OUT
I WANT TO FLY TO A PLACE WHERE
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
NOBODY ELSE SO WE CAN BE FREE
NOBODY ELSE SO WE CAN BE FREE

<♪>
AND I'M ALL MIXED UP
FEELING CORNERED AND RUSHED
THEY SAY IT'S MY FAULT
BUT I WANT HER SO MUCH
I WANNA FLY HER AWAY
WITH THE SUN AND THE RAIN
COVERED OVER MY FACE
WASH AWAY ALL THE SHAME
WHEN THEY STOP AND STARE
DON'T WORRY ME
CAUSE I'M FEELING FOR HER
WHAT SHE'S FEELING FOR ME
I CAN TRY TO PRETEND
I CAN TRY TO FORGET
BUT IT'S DRIVING ME MAD
GOING OUT OF MY HEAD
ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID
